# Thesis

This repository contains the source code for the Master's thesis "Comparing Statistically Based Constant-Time Analysis Tools for Identifying Timing Side-Channels in CRYSTALS-Kyber". The code used for payload generation, collection of timing measurements, running the studied tools, and evaluating the tools' verdicts can all be found in the `src` folder.

The `data` folder contains the tools' verdicts for different noise levels and payload approaches. Due to their size, the payloads used, as well as the collected timing measurements, have been uploaded to Zenodo. The different data sets uploaded to Zenodo can be found here:
- [Collected timing measurements](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15742155)
- [Naive payloads](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15742243)
- [Vulnerability specific payloads (1 of 2)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15742287)
- [Vulnerability specific payloads (2 of 2)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15742333)
