# Thesis

This repository contains the source code for the Master's thesis "Comparing Statistically Based Constant-Time Analysis Tools for Identifying Timing Side-Channels in CRYSTALS-Kyber". The code used for payload generation, collection of timing measurements, running the studied tools, and evaluating the tools' verdicts can all be found in the `src` folder.

The `data` folder contains the tools' verdicts for different noise levels and payload approaches. Due to their size, the payloads used, as well as the collected timing measurements, can be found here.
